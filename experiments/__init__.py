RAE Research Experiments

Research-grade experiments for validating the mathematical model of agent memory.

Experiments:
1. Structural Stability Test - How memory structure evolves
2. Drift Dynamics Test - Semantic and structural drift analysis
3. Reflection Gain Analysis - Quality improvement from reflection
4. Robustness & Poisoning - Handling conflicting information
5. Memory Policy Optimization - Comparing reflection policies
6. Entropy Minimization - Natural organization tendency
7. Baseline Comparisons - RAG vs RAE-no-reflection vs full RAE
