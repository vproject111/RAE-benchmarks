# RAE Benchmarks Data

This repository contains **benchmark results, artifacts, and plots** for the [RAE (Robotic Agent Emulation)](https://github.com/dreamsoft-pro/RAE-agentic-memory) project.

## Purpose
To keep the main repository lightweight, all heavy benchmark artifacts (PNG plots, large JSON result files) are stored here. This ensures full transparency and replicability of our performance claims without bloating the source code history.

## Structure
- `plots/`: Visualizations of benchmark runs (latency, MRR, drift).
- `results/`: Raw JSON/Markdown reports from benchmark executions.

## Usage
These files are automatically generated by the RAE benchmarking suite and pushed here by the CI/CD pipeline or authorized agents.
