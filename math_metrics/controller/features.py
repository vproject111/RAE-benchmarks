    Extracted features from task context for decision making.

    These features form the observation space for the controller.
    In Iteration 1, they are used for rule-based decisions.
    In later iterations, they become the state vector for learning algorithms.

    Attributes:
        task_type: Type of memory operation being performed
        memory_count: Current number of memories in the system
        graph_density: Density of knowledge graph (edges / max_edges)
        session_length: Number of turns in current session
        memory_entropy: Entropy of memory distribution (from math_metrics)
        recent_mrr: Mean Reciprocal Rank from recent queries
        recent_gcs: Graph Connectivity Score
        recent_scs: Semantic Coherence Score
        cost_budget: Remaining cost budget (USD), None if unlimited
        latency_budget_ms: Maximum allowed latency, None if unlimited
        previous_level: Level used in previous decision (for stability)
        previous_level_success: Whether previous decision was successful
        custom: Additional custom features for extensibility
